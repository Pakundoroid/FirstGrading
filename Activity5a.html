	<center><h2>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h2></center>
	<blockquote><p><t>A programming language is a computer language programmers use to develop software programs, scripts, or other sets of instructions for computers to execute. Although many languages share similarities, each has its own syntax. Once a programmer learns the languages rules, syntax, and structure, they write the source code in a text editor or IDE. Then, the programmer often compiles the code into machine language that can be understood by the computer. Scripting languages, which do not require a compiler, use an interpreter to execute the script. Today, there are hundreds of different programming languages. The following section contains an index of the different programming and scripting languages currently listed on our site. Clicking on any of the following languages displays an explanation and examples of that language. Application and program development involves programs you work with on a daily basis. For example, the Internet browser you are using to view this web page is considered a program. Artificial intelligence or related fields involve creating the character interactions in computer games, portions of programs that make decisions, chatbots, and more. Database developers create and maintain databases. Game development involves creating computer games or other entertainment software. Computer drivers and programming hardware interface support are a necessity for hardware functionality. Internet and web page development are the essence of the Internet. Without developers, the Internet would not exist. Although it is not likely to become a career, knowing how to create and develop scripts can increase productivity for you or your company, saving you countless hours. As computers have evolved, many different computer programming languages created for various types of development. Although we do have several dozen languages listed on our site, there are hundreds that we don't have listed. To get an idea of the different programming languages, you can visit The Hello World Collection, which gives a demo of how to write "Hello World" in over 591 different programming languages.</p>
